# Accenture-Job-Simulation-on-Content-Category
This short project is about providing data insights and content category analysis for a social media client who needs to analyze their media space. Microsoft Excel and Power BI were the tools engaged in this project. 
Required datasets for the task were identified and filtered using Microsoft Excel.
The datasets were cleaned and merged based on relationships to prepare them for analysis with the manage relationships feature on Power BI. A dashboard that answered the clients questions and KPIs like the top 5 content categories, reaction score of content categories, was created in Power BI.
